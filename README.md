# ismr.space

This is a simple site I wrote over a weekend as a joke for one of my favorite podcasts, [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected). Connected is a tech podcast focused on the Apple ecosystem and is a great listen. 10/10 would recommend.

In the podcast, one of the hosts started a running joke where he would do bad [ASMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR). Someone in the podcast's Discord server suggested someone make a site to play back the clips and I decided to go for it.

The name `ISMR` comes from a portmanteau of ASMR and [@ismh](https://twitter.com/ismh) (the host's Twitter handle).

The site is pure vanilla JS and hosted on GitHub Pages with automatic deployments. I don't have very much public programming work, as the vast majority of my time is spent programming for my company, but I'm proud of this site.

If you want to listen to the host's reaction, it was during episode 303 at 6:48 (a direct link to the moment https://overcast.fm/+FXx4lNhtU/06:48).
